2 types of Version Control

Centralized: Files, or data stored in one place, negative side to this would be unable to restore quickly if there was a disaster.

Distributed: Storings files or data into different buildings that have servers. This would allow to retrieve the data if one building went down.

Platforms for GIT (Gitlab, Github, Bitbucket)
We are storing tracked info on our codes.

1. We created an account through Gitlab / Github / Bitbucket
2. We generated SSH-keygen
3. Took the .ssh pub key and stored into our preferences ssh and gave expiration.
4. Once you have created a repo, make sure you check
your terminal
	-git config --global user.name
	-git config --global user.email
5. We need to initialize our new project in IntelliJ
	-git init
6. .gitignore - Will not track changes and this will not add to your repo.
7. Follow these commands to add to repo.
	-git add .
	-git commit -m "initial push"
	-git push (new branch there 4th step)
	-git push -u origin master or main
