10/11/2022 - Git-2 Recap, Branching, and Merging 

1. We need to check if the Git is installed on our machine $ git version. If not install it

2. We have created a project on the git.

3. using commands 
$ git config --global user.name "your username"
$ git config --global user.email "your email"

we let git on our machine knows my GitLab account 

4. ssh key
   
   having git on my machines know the gitlab is not sufficient to exchange the data between my local and remote. So, we need shh set on our machine and GitLab


5. Create your local project and make it git repo with $ git init command

git add .
git commit -m "your message"

use this comment to let your local to know your remote project 
$ git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:techglobal.school/b5_recap.git

$ git push -u origin master push your project to remote

BRANCHING

You need to create your own branch before you start writing you test script. 

You should not create or switch any branch before committing your changes on the current branch.

After you switch to your your branch you can write your test script. 

Then, commit all the changes

And use $ git push command (Intellij is giving you a required command. Just copy the text)

On the gitlab switch the branch to your branch

And create your Merge request and make sure it is from your branch into the master branch

Put your meaningful title and create your MR

Merge your MR

Then go to your local, switch from your branch to master branch. (Make sure there is nothing to commit)

When you are on the master branch on your local
Then use $ git pull command
