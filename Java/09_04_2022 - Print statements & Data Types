RECAP:

Computer:
Input -> Process -> Output


Programming Language:
High-level languages -> Java, JS, C#, PHP


Source code vs byte code vs binary code
byte code is ONLY used with JAVA

source code -> javac -> byte code -> java -> binary

compiler -> syntax errors
runtime errors -> StringIndexOutOfBoundException

String name = "John";
0. J
1. o
3. n

System.out.println(name.charAt(2));


java vs javac
javac -> compiles the source code
java -> executes the compiled code



JAVA COMPONENTS:
JDK = JRE + development tools
JRE = JVM + libraries
JVM also has JIT (Just in Time Compiler)

main() method
-main() method is the start point of the execution of a program
-JVM looks to the main() method first. Then, start executing code from top to bottom and left to right


public static void main(String[] args){
	//this is main method
	//The code written here will be executed
}


{} -> block of code

println()




NAMING CONVENTION - GOOD CODE
All the class names, package names, variables names MUST be meaningful which makes our code more readable


HOW WE CAN MAKE OUR CODE MORE READABLE?
Use comments



print() vs println() methods
-Both of methods belongs to the System class of Java
-They are called-invoked with the System class

System.out.println(text);
System.out.print(text);

ln = line



HOW TO DEBUG
1. put a breakpoint (red dot) next to line you want to pause the code
2. Run your code with "Debug" option
3. Use "Step Over" or F8 to execute code line by line
4. DO NOT FORGET TO REMOVE YOUR BREAKPOINT AFTER DEBUGGING



ESCAPE SEQUENCES
""
\
\t 	-> it provides a tab space (8 characters) 
\n 	-> it provides a new line



Concatenation
-It is combining 2 or more strings
-We use + (plus) operator to concatenate multiple strings
-String is a sequence of characters
-EXAMPLES: "Hello", "@#%@#", "", " ", "    ", "23423"

System.out.println("Hello World"); // Hello World
System.out.println("Hello" + " " + "World") // Hello World


""apple"" -> compiler error
"\"apple\""

NOTE:
System.out.println(); //This is going to add one empty line to the console


3, 5, 10000000
56.5
1875223.23

A char
X
%

true/false -> boolean



All the identifiers must be named meaningfully
package: starts with lowercase, follows camelcase, no spaces
class name: starts with uppercase, follows camelcase, no spaces
variable name: starts with lowercase, follows camelcase, no spaces
myNumber, studentAge, studentPhoneNumber, age, balance
